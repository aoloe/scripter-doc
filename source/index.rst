Introduction
============
Scribus is an Open Source program that brings professional page layout to Linux/UNIX, Mac OS X, OS/2 Warp 4/eComStation and Windows desktops with a combination of press-ready output and new approaches to page design.
Underneath a modern and user-friendly interface, Scribus supports professional publishing features, such as color separations, CMYK and Spot Color support, ICC color management, and versatile PDF creation.

Scripter2 is newly developed Scripting Engine for Scribus which enables experienced users to develop python scripts to perform custom operations like generation of table of contents, barcode or more.
